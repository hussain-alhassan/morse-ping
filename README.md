Cryptography is secure in that it encodes a message to make it unreadable by unintended viewers. However, cryptographic keys always pose the risk of being cracked. Steganography uses a different approach to secure communication by hiding the existence of the message entirely. Steganography can be implemented through different mediums such as images, audio files, and even through the exploitation of protocols. This project proposes using timing channel steganography to use the UDP protocol to allow messages to be secretly sent in a manner similar to Morse code.
